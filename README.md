## Design Principles

Markdown can be beautiful without bloat, accessible without sacrificing creativity, practical while remaining artistic, and simple yet expressive. This repository challenges the assumption that Markdown is merely utilitarian.

## Quality Checklist

Before publishing Markdown documentation:
- Clear hierarchy with consistent heading levels (h1 to h6)
- Descriptive link text avoiding "click here" patterns
- Code blocks specify language for syntax highlighting
- Consistent list formatting throughout document
- Images include descriptive alt text
- Tables used appropriately, not for layout
- No orphaned formatting (bold/italic without context)
- Terminal-viewable with critical info accessible without images
- Cross-platform tested (GitHub, GitLab, VS Code, etc.)

## Contributing

Contributions welcome: new templates for common scenarios, style improvements to existing guides, gallery submissions of excellent documentation, creative techniques and experimental approaches, bug reports and clarifications.

Requirements: check existing templates first, test Markdown across multiple platforms, include examples and use cases, follow contribution guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md.
