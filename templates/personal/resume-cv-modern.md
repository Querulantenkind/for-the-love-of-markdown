  TEMPLATE: Modern Resume / CV
  COMPLEXITY: Medium
  FEATURES: Two-column layout (via tables), clean typography, print-friendly structure
  NOTE: Tables are used here for layout because Markdown lacks CSS grid support. 
        This renders well on GitHub but may need adjustment for PDF conversion.
