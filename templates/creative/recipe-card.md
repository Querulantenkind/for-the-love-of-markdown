## 🛒 Ingredients

### The Core
- [ ] **Spaghetti**: 200g (High quality durum wheat)
- [ ] **Guanciale**: 100g (Cured pork jowl), cut into strips
- [ ] **Pecorino Romano**: 60g, freshly grated
- [ ] **Eggs**: 2 large yolks + 1 whole egg
- [ ] **Black Pepper**: Freshly cracked (lots of it)

- [ ] Pasta water (Liquid gold)

## 👩‍🍳 Instructions

### 1. Crisp the Guanciale
Put the guanciale strips in a cold pan. Turn heat to medium-low. Let the fat render slowly until the meat is golden and crispy.
> **Tip**: Don't throw away the rendered fat! We need it.

### 2. Prepare the "Carbo Cream"
In a bowl, whisk the **eggs**, **Pecorino**, and a generous amount of **black pepper** until it forms a thick paste. Add a teaspoon of the rendered pork fat to temper the eggs.

### 3. Cook the Pasta
Boil the spaghetti in salted water. Cook until *al dente* (usually 1-2 mins less than package instructions).

### 4. The Magic Moment (Emulsification)
1.  Turn off the heat on the guanciale pan.
2.  Transfer the pasta directly to the pan.
3.  Add a splash of pasta water. Toss to cool slightly.
4.  **Pour the egg mixture in.**
5.  *Stir vigorously!* The residual heat will cook the eggs into a creamy sauce without scrambling them.

### 5. Serve
Plate immediately. Top with extra Pecorino and more black pepper.

## 🍷 Pairing

| :--- | :--- |
| **Frascati Superiore** | A crisp white from Rome cuts through the fat. |
| **Chianti Classico** | If you prefer red, choose something with high acidity. |
